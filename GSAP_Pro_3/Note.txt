if we use the repeat propery then and provide any x value to it then that repeat will work x+1 times because once it will work for the written code and then it will work x repeat times.

and if we provide the value of repeat as -1 then it will keep on happening in a loop


yoyo: is property which takes true or false value only ture is for normal working 
it is used to make the transition similar similar from end side as it was on the starting side.
